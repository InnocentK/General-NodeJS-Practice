For this problem, you need to write a program 
that takes in a file name and an integer, N, 
and returns the first N unique words in the file given. 
These can be hard coded into your program, but should be very easy to change, 
either through constants or as parameters to a function in your code. 
If the file given contains less than N unique words, 
all unique words in the file should be printed, without any error conditions
